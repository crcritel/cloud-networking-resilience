### 🧭 Overview

This repository serves as the official companion resource for the book *Cloud Networking and Resilience*, providing all the supporting materials referenced throughout its chapters.  
It is organized to mirror the book’s structure and includes practical assets that allow readers, architects, and engineers to reproduce and extend the concepts demonstrated in the text.

Each chapter explores how modern cloud network architectures can be designed, operated, and tested for **resilience**, **availability**, and **fault tolerance** — with a focus on AWS as the reference implementation.

### 💬 Author’s Note

This project is dedicated to **Ade (2017 – 2022)** — my beloved Bengal cat, brother, son, dearest friend, and constant companion.  

Through his quiet strength, unwavering loyalty, and gentle presence, he taught me what resilience truly means in life.  
In my work, I design for resilience every day — and it felt only natural to honor him here, with his face on this book,  
so that everyone who reads it sees the inspiration behind both my life’s work and this journey.  

The repository will continue to evolve as new chapters, updates, and resources are released,  
ensuring that the book’s examples remain current with the latest advancements in cloud networking and AWS services.

### 📗 About the Book

*Cloud Networking and Resilience* is a deep technical guide to designing and operating reliable cloud network architectures at scale.  
It bridges foundational networking principles with modern cloud-native constructs — from **DNS resilience** and **BGP engineering** to **multi-region failover**, **automation**, and **chaos testing**.

The book spans **nine chapters**, grouped across three major sections:

1. **Foundations of Cloud Resilience** – Concepts, definitions, and network fundamentals (Ch. 1–3)  
2. **Designing Resilient Network Architectures** – Techniques and architectures across layers (Ch. 4–7)  
3. **Automating and Future-Proofing Resilience** – Observability, chaos, AI-driven fault detection, and the future of cloud networking (Ch. 8–9)
