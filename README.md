## 📘 About This Repository
This repository contains supporting examples, configurations, and diagrams referenced throughout the book *Cloud Networking and Resilience*.  
It is organized to mirror the structure of the chapters, focusing on practical implementation of cloud networking and resilience patterns across AWS and hybrid environments.
